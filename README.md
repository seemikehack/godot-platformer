# Godot Platformer

This is a simple platformer that I decided to work on after completing
the Godot 2D tutorial and barely starting a shmup to help me continue
learning about Godot, and also because platformers are classic. PRs
with suggested optimizations or improvements are welcome.

## How to Play

Move and jump with WASD (yes, that's it for now, more to follow soon).
